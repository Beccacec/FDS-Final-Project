# FDS-Final-Project

Our dataset is Airbnb Dataset in Rome.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocrisafulli/airbnb-italy

We want to classify whether our target value "PriceClass" is high or low for the property.

If the price of a property is higher than the average, it would be defined as an expensive one, otherwise a cheap one. 
# 1 represent that a property is expensive 
# 0 indicates cheap one
